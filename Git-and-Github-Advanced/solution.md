#TASK2
#Here is the difference between revert and reset :

Revert -> we use git revert when we mistakenly commited a file and now we have to stage it or wants to come one step before. But revert command prints the history in commit logs.

Reset -> we use git reset when we mistakenly committed a file and wants to come one step or two step before without getting the history printed in logs. 
There are three types of reset : --soft(to stage the committed file), --mixed(to unstage a committed file), --hard(to completely delete the file) and all these three works without the history printed.

So, when the history dont matters, we use revert. 
But, when we don't want someone to know about history or our mistake we use git reset.


#TASK3
#Here is difference between git stash pop and git stash apply

Git stash apply : when we dont want to commit the changes and wants the changes to be saved without committing then we use git stash apply.

Git stash pop : when we want to unstash or want to see the saved details inside stash then we use stash pop.

we use git stash when we want to switch branches but dont want to commit.
